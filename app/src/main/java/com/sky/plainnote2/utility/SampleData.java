                    "Determining what exactly separates a short story from longer fictional formats is problematic. A  classic definition of a short story is that one should be able to read it in one sitting, a point most notably made in Edgar Allan Poe's essay \"The Philosophy of Composition\" (1846).[1] According to William Faulkner, a short story is character driven and a writer's job is to \"...trot along behind him with a paper and pencil trying to keep up long enough to put down what he says and does.‚Äù[2]\n" +

                    "Some authors have argued that a short story must have a strict form. Somerset Maugham thought that the short story \"must have a definite design, which includes a point of departure, a climax and a point of test; in other words, it must have a plot\". This view is however opposed by Anton Chekov who thought that a story should have neither a beginning nor an end. It should just be a \"slice of life\", presented suggestively.[3]";
